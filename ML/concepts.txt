what is machine learning?
   a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms 
   to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

how is machine learning different from rpa?
  RPA focuses on replicating human behavior, ML solutions imitate how we think and learn

how it helps?
   helps companies predict consumer purchasing habits, market trends, and popular products, allowing retailers 
   to make informed business decisions based on this predicted information.

- what is regression?
  --A regression is a statistical technique that relates a dependent variable 
  to one or more 
  independent (explanatory) variables.

  what is correaltion?
  --Correlation quantifies the strength of the linear relationship between a pair 
  of variables, 
  whereas regression expresses the relationship in the form of an equation.

-- what is classification?
  -Classification is a supervised machine learning method where the model 
  tries to predict the correct label of a given input data. 
  In classification, the model is fully trained using the training data, 
  and then it is evaluated on test data before being used to perform 
  prediction on new unseen data.

-- what is clustering?
  -Clustering is the act of organizing similar objects into groups 
  within a machine learning algorithm. Assigning related objects into clusters is 
  beneficial for AI models. Clustering has many uses in data science, like image 
  processing, knowledge discovery in data, unsupervised learning, and various other 
  applications.

-- what is association rule learning?

  -Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering 
  interesting relations between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify 
  strong rules discovered in databases using some measures of interestingness.
