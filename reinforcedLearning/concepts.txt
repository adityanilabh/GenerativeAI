what is reinforced learning?
-- a machine learning training method based on rewarding desired behaviors and 
   punishing undesired ones
-- to train AI agents to navigate and interact with these environments. 
   RL algorithms can generate optimal paths, identify potential obstacles, and adjust the 
   behavior of NPCs based on their interactions with the game world.

--supervised learning: teach a machine to search and identify patterns.

--The Reinforcement Learning problem involves an agent exploring an unknown 
  environment to achieve a goal. RL is based on the hypothesis that 
  all goals can be described by the maximization of expected cumulative reward

  application of reinforcement learning?
  - we get to explore new things not known 
  - non biasness.
  -able to learn online in real time.

  - bussiness need for reinforcement learning?
  --creating personalised learning
  --optimising advertising budgets.
  --selecting best content for advertising.
  -- minimise the ammount of time non optimal content is displayed.
  --predicting customer response to price plan change.
